This study uses network analysis to examine the evolution of the EU banking sector from 2006 to 2022. Using data from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), we construct a series of weighted networks representing cross-border lending between EU countriesâ€™ banking sectors. Our analysis focuses on centrality metrics to identify key financial players and changes in interconnectivity over time. Special attention is given to the impact of major economic events, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, on the network structure. The results highlight Germany and France's consistent centrality, while Greece's financial interactions reflect significant fluctuations corresponding to its economic challenges and recovery phases. This study provides insights into the dynamic nature of financial relationships within the EU banking sector.
